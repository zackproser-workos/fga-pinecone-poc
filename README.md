# FGA Document Access Control POC

## Overview
This proof-of-concept demonstrates fine-grained access control for document management using WorkOS FGA (Fine-Grained Authorization) integrated with Pinecone vector database. The system allows:

- Document ownership and sharing permissions
- PDF processing and chunking for vector storage
- Access-controlled vector search based on user permissions
- Demonstration of permission inheritance and access control checks

## Tech Stack
- WorkOS FGA for authorization
- Pinecone for vector storage
- LangChain for PDF processing
- Node.js/TypeScript

## Prerequisites
- Node.js v20.5.0 or newer
- WorkOS API Key
- Pinecone API Key and Environment
- zsh (for running scripts)

## Setup

1. Copy environment variables and fill in secrets:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API keys
```

2. Set up the WorkOS authorization model:
```bash
export WORKOS_API_KEY=your_key_here
./src/scripts/defineResourceTypes.sh
```

3. Process documents and create vector embeddings:
```bash
node src/scripts/setupPinecone.js
```

4. Run the demo to test access controls and search:
```bash
node src/scripts/demo.js
```

## Usage

### Check Access Permissions
```bash
npm run check-access
```
Demonstrates checking whether users have access to specific documents.

### Process Documents
```bash
npm run process-docs
```
Process PDF documents:
- Chunks documents using LangChain
- Creates vector embeddings
- Stores in Pinecone with metadata including document ID

### Query Documents
```bash
npm run query-docs
```
Demonstrates:
- Checking user permissions before querying
- Filtering Pinecone results based on accessible documents
- Vector similarity search within permitted documents

## API Examples

### Create a Warrant
```typescript
const warrant = {
  object_type: 'document',
  object_id: 'doc1',
  relation: 'owner',
  subject_type: 'user',
  subject_id: 'user1'
};

const response = await workos.fga.batchWriteWarrants([warrant]);
```

### Check Access
```typescript
const hasAccess = await workos.fga.checkWarrant({
  object_type: 'document',
  object_id: 'doc1',
  relation: 'viewer',
  subject_type: 'user',
  subject_id: 'user1'
});
```

### Query Documents with Access Control
```typescript
const results = await queryDocuments('user1', 'search query');
```

## Development

### Adding New Resource Types
1. Add new resource type definition to `defineResourceTypes.sh`
2. Run the script to create the new type
3. Update TypeScript types in `models/types.ts`

### Adding New Relations
1. Modify the resource type definition in `defineResourceTypes.sh`
2. Delete and recreate the resource type (note: this will delete existing warrants)
3. Update relevant access check logic

## Architecture

### Setup Phase
1. `defineResourceTypes.sh` creates two resource types in WorkOS FGA:
   - `document`: has "owner" and "viewer" relations (owners automatically get viewer access)
   - `user`: represents system users

2. `setupPinecone.js` prepares the document data:
   - Processes PDF documents into text chunks
   - Creates vector embeddings for each chunk
   - Stores vectors in Pinecone with document IDs as metadata

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[defineResourceTypes.sh] -->|Creates| B[WorkOS Resource Types]
    B -->|Defines| C[document & user types]
    C -->|Defines Relations| D[owner & viewer]
    
    E[setupPinecone.js] -->|Processes| F[PDF Documents]
    F -->|Creates| G[Vector Embeddings]
    G -->|Stores in| H[Pinecone Index]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style E fill:#e1f5fe
    style H fill:#fff3e0
    style B fill:#fff3e0
```

### Runtime Phase
1. `demo.js` sets up access permissions:
   - Creates warrants in WorkOS FGA (e.g., "user1 owns doc_sherlock-holmes")
   - These warrants determine who can access which documents

2. When a user makes a search query:
   - System checks WorkOS FGA to get list of documents the user can access
   - Uses these document IDs to filter Pinecone search results
   - Returns only results from documents the user has permission to view

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[demo.js] -->|Creates| B[WorkOS Warrants]
    B -->|Grants Access| C[user1 owns Sherlock]
    B -->|Grants Access| D[user2 views Federalist]
    
    E[User Query] -->|Triggers| F[Access Check]
    F -->|Calls| G[WorkOS FGA Check]
    G -->|Returns| H[Accessible Doc IDs]
    
    H -->|Filters| I[Pinecone Query]
    I -->|Returns| J[Filtered Results]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style G fill:#fff3e0
    style I fill:#fff3e0
```

This ensures users can only search within documents they have been granted access to, either as an owner or viewer.
